Referencing the designs below, create an iOS application that mimics a minimal amount and very basic functionality of the below screens.

## Design Preview

## Requirements

Develop a the full design according to the following requirements.

- Fork this repo before making any changes
- Frequently commit your changes to GIT, with proper messages on each commit.
- Colors should be the same hex/rgb values that appear within the screenshots
- Code should be well documented, with adequate comments explaining relevant sections.
- Designs should scale down to at least iPhone 5 (preferrably using AutoLayout)
- Ignore all animations. The zoom in effect that appears when tapping an image does not need to be replicated, nor do you have to make it so that you can swipe on the image to get to the next.

### BONUS:
- Make top sliding navigation work in such a way that tapping on the menu options changes the screen to a white UIView
